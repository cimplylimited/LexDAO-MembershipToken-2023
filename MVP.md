# Introduction
LexDAO has been working for the last two years to try to move into a stable and long-term solution for managing its membership.  Our specifications have been developed in the [Readme File](https://github.com/cimplylimited/LexDAO-MembershipToken-2023) to determine the base needs for the organization.  

In all of our investigations to-date, the best solution we have begun the process of implementing through a provider known as [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/) which offers ERC-721 tokens that are fully configurable and can be implemented on a variety of common L1 and L2 blockchains.
